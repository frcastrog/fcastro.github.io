    "text": "Abstract\nDoes mass emigration encourage or undermine protests? Emigration, being a personal decision made by households, can potentially aggregate into a collective expression of discontent against the prevailing status quo. In this paper, we focus on whether large-scale emigration influences protest support and participation. Using a survey experiment conducted in Honduras, we assess how emigration’s salience affected public opinion about anti-government demonstrations in 2021. Our findings reveal that respondents primed with information about migration expressed more favorable opinions toward protests, although their participation in demonstrations was unaffected. This study contributes to a better understanding of the link between emigration and public opinion for those who stay in their origin country, and also its limitations to mobilizing for change during periods of political turmoil."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe relationship between state repression and protest mobilization presents a complex puzzle. Repression can sometimes deter street protests, yet in other instances, it paradoxically intensifies them. Focusing on Chile, this study analyzes the variable effects of repression tactics. Short-term data show arrests and beatings often increase protests, while rubber bullets exhibit a deterrent effect. The findings are contextualized within a theoretical framework that emphasizes the interplay between the costs associated with repression and their degree of targeting. This approach sheds light on the mechanisms behind the backfiring of repression and questions its efficacy in curbing dissent, particularly in democratic settings."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nEmerging research on the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic draws attention to the labor effects of the crisis in the Global South. Developing countries show high levels of labor informality, where most workers cannot work from home and depend on daily income. In addition, the scarce and late state aid makes it difficult for workers to cope with the economic hardships caused by the pandemic. This research explores the employment trajectories of workers throughout the ongoing pandemic in Chile: a neoliberal country with a strong male breadwinner culture and high levels of income inequality. Using longitudinal non-probabilistic data for Chilean employment, this study finds that men lost their jobs to a lesser extent and returned to the labor market faster than women. Likewise, male workers with family (with a partner and young children) remained employed in a higher proportion than female workers with family, and most of these women shifted from employment into care work. The existing literature already pointed out how economic crises can have adverse effects on progress towards gender equality, and the current economic crisis seems to be no exception. Labor informality and low-skilled jobs were highly related to unemployment during the first months of COVID in Chile. These are important variables in a developing economy such as Chile, where around one-third of the population works under these conditions. This article concludes by reflecting on the importance of addressing the present crisis and future economic recovery with a gender perspective."

    "text": "Abstract\nCan protests prompt changes in electoral behavior? In this paper, we examine variations in voter turnout and electoral preferences at the local level after a protest cycle. Using data on protest occurrence during the 2019 social mobilizations in Chile and Bolivia, we assess the impact that street demonstrations had on voting behavior in the elections that took place in the following year. Through a difference-in-differences design, we found that protests both increased turnout and changed electoral preferences. We argue that the rise in turnout is explained by the surge in political efficacy that emerged from the protests. Additionally, the protests generated a signaling effect, causing municipalities that had protests to vote for the incumbent party to a lesser extent. Our results reinforce the importance of protests on electoral behavior, not only because they mobilize people to vote, but also because they could potentially trigger electoral punishment towards the ruling party."
