    "text": "Abstract\nThe relationship between state repression and protest mobilization presents a complex puzzle. Repression can sometimes deter street protests, yet in other instances, it paradoxically intensifies them. Focusing on Chile, this study analyzes the variable effects of repression tactics. Short-term data show arrests and beatings often increase protests, while rubber bullets exhibit a deterrent effect. The findings are contextualized within a theoretical framework that emphasizes the interplay between the costs associated with repression and their degree of targeting. This approach sheds light on the mechanisms behind the backfiring of repression and questions its efficacy in curbing dissent, particularly in democratic settings."

Tal como se realizó en LAPOP 2012, la definición de capacidad estatal estará limitada o entendida en sus términos mínimos, es decir, como la capacidad del Estado de proveer bienes y servicios públicos. La base fundamental tanto del año 2012 como del presente año, es que la capacidad del Estado se ha mostrado heterogénea no sólo a niveles comparados entre países, sino que también a niveles sub-nacionales. Sumado a lo anterior, -y al igual que lo demostrado en el anterior informe (LAPOP 2012)- se establece que no sólo existen diferencias entre los países, sino que también dentro de los países."

Using data on protest occurrence during the 2019 social mobilizations in Chile and Bolivia, we assess the impact that street demonstrations had on voting behavior in the elections that took place in the following year. Through a difference-in-differences design, we found that protests both increased turnout and changed electoral preferences. We argue that the rise in turnout is explained by the surge in political efficacy that emerged from the protests. Additionally, the protests generated a signaling effect, causing municipalities that had protests to vote for the incumbent party to a lesser extent. Our results reinforce the importance of protests on electoral behavior, not only because they mobilize people to vote, but also because they could potentially trigger electoral punishment towards the ruling party."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nEmerging research on the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic draws attention to the labor effects of the crisis in the Global South. Developing countries show high levels of labor informality, where most workers cannot work from home and depend on daily income. In addition, the scarce and late state aid makes it difficult for workers to cope with the economic hardships caused by the pandemic. This research explores the employment trajectories of workers throughout the ongoing pandemic in Chile: a neoliberal country with a strong male breadwinner culture and high levels of income inequality. Using longitudinal non-probabilistic data for Chilean employment, this study finds that men lost their jobs to a lesser extent and returned to the labor market faster than women. Likewise, male workers with family (with a partner and young children) remained employed in a higher proportion than female workers with family, and most of these women shifted from employment into care work. The existing literature already pointed out how economic crises can have adverse effects on progress towards gender equality, and the current economic crisis seems to be no exception. Labor informality and low-skilled jobs were highly related to unemployment during the first months of COVID in Chile. These are important variables in a developing economy such as Chile, where around one-third of the population works under these conditions. This article concludes by reflecting on the importance of addressing the present crisis and future economic recovery with a gender perspective."

    "text": "Abstract\nState repression’s effect on protest behavior is theorized to depend on two key dimensions: its severity (level of harm imposed) and selectivity (whether targeted or indiscriminate). While scholars have developed sophisticated theoretical frameworks around these dimensions, most empirical evidence comes from authoritarian contexts. Moreover, we lack systematic evidence about how specific combinations of severity and selectivity influence protest dynamics. Using data from Chile’s 2019 protest cycle, I examine how different tactical combinations shape subsequent mobilization. Through models accounting for spatial dynamics and temporal effects, I find patterns that challenge theoretical expectations. Contrary to predictions, selective high-severity tactics generated short-term mobilization rather than deterrence, while low-severity tactics produced significant protest increases regardless of their selectivity. Survey evidence reveals that these effects operated partly through public attitudes. These findings demonstrate the need to revise theoretical frameworks around severity and selectivity, particularly in democratic contexts."
