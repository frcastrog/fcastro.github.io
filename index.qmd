My name is Francisca Castro and I'm a PhD Candidate in Political Science at the Berlin Graduate School of Social Sciences (BGSS).

I work as a [Research Fellow](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sowi.hu-berlin.de%2Fen%2Flehrbereiche-en%2Finternational-politics%2FTeam%2Fstaff%2F1693006&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1gEFEgsim-dhjHX84OvwLC) in the Chair of International Politics at the Institute of Social Sciences of Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin, Germany.

My research interests are intrastate conflict, protests and social movements, state repression, and democratic backsliding.
