My name is Francisca Castro and I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher at the International Security and Development Center ([ISDC](https://isdc.org/)), where I work on conflict and vulnerability of political regimes.

I'm also associated to the ERC Grant [Participation & Representation in the Digital Age](https://www.prd-erc.eu/).

Previously, I worked as a Doctoral Researcher in the Chair of International Politics at the Institute of Social Sciences of Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin, Germany.

My research interests are intrastate conflict, protests and social movements, state repression, and democratic backsliding.
