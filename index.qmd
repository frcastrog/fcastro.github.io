My name is Francisca Castro and I'm a third-year PhD Candidate in Political Science at the Berlin Graduate School of Social Sciences (BGSS).

I work as a [Research Fellow](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/lehrbereiche-en/international-politics/Team/staff/1693006) in the Chair of International Politics at the Institute of Social Sciences of Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin, Germany.

My research interests are intrastate conflict, protests and social movements, state repression, and democratic backsliding.
