## Abstract

The relationship between state repression and protest mobilization presents a complex puzzle. Repression can sometimes deter street protests, yet in other instances, it paradoxically intensifies them. Focusing on Chile, this study analyzes the variable effects of repression tactics. Short-term data show arrests and beatings often increase protests, while rubber bullets exhibit a deterrent effect. The findings are contextualized within a theoretical framework that emphasizes the interplay between the costs associated with repression and their degree of targeting. This approach sheds light on the mechanisms behind the backfiring of repression and questions its efficacy in curbing dissent, particularly in democratic settings.
